##1. Python using Anaconda:
Install a python version using Anaconda, to run TensorFlow within the Jupyter notebook.

Installation link:
https://repo.anaconda.com/archive

## 2. Microsoft Visual Visual C++ 
TensorFlow necessitates C++ Build tools, and CUDA requires Visual Studio.

Installation link:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

## 3. CUDA and CUDNN for NVIDIA
If you are using an Nvidia GPU, you need to install CUDA and CUDNN to accelerate the Deep learning process and training.

Check the versions of Tensorflow_gpu from the below link and install the corresponding CDA and CUDNN:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows

CUDA installation link:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.2.0-download-archive

CUDNN installtion link:
https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive

## 4. Protocol Buffers
These are the formats that the TensorFlow saves the model in. TensorFlow graphs are represented in a format called protocol buffer.

Install Protoc for Protocol Buffers from the below official Github Repo link:
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases

## 5. Git Bash
This allows us to use Git commands.

Installation link:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

## 5. TensorFlow Object Dtection API
The TensorFlow Object Detection API is a open-source framework, developed on TensorFlow. It helps to build, train, and deploy the object detection models. The framework includes pre-trained models, referred to as the Model Zoo.
