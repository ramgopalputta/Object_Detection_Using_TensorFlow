# ABSTRACT
This project focuses on implementing sign language detection model using TensorFlow. By utilizing our webcam, we collect images of different signs and label them using 'LabelImg.' Next, we employ the Transfer Learning approach with the TensorFlow Object Detection API, using SSD MobileNet for training. The result is real-time sign language detection through Python and openCV, enabling the identification of sign language poses via the webcam. 


# LABELLING IMAGES FOR OBJECT DETECTION USING 'LABELIMG
We will be using our own webcam to collect the images of various signs and then passes to 'LabelImg', which is is a graphical image annotation tool  

# TRAINING TENSORFLOW FOR SIGN LANGUAGE
Now, we are going to use Transfer leraning approach against the TensorFloe object detection API using SSD MobileNet

# DETECTING SIGN LANGUAGE IN REAL TIME
Finally, using python and openCv, real time sign language poses are detected via your webcam.
