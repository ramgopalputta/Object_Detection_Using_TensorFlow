# ABSTRACT



# LABELLING IMAGES FOR OBJECT DETECTION USING 'LABELIMG
We will be using our own webcam to collect the images of various signs and then passes to 'LabelImg', which is is a graphical image annotation tool  

# TRAINING TENSORFLOW FOR SIGN LANGUAGE
Now, we are going to use Transfer leraning approach against the TensorFloe object detection API using SSD MobileNet

# DETECTING SIGN LANGUAGE IN REAL TIME
Finally, using python and openCv, real time sign language poses are detected via your webcam.
