# ABSTRACT



# 



# REQUIRED INSTALLATIONS AND SETTING UP ENVIRONMENT:

## 1. Python using Anaconda:
Install a python version using Anaconda, to run Tensor Flow inside the Jupyter notebook.

Installation link:
https://repo.anaconda.com/archive

## 2. Microsoft Visual Visual C++ 
TensorFlow relies on C++ Build tools and also CUDA needs Visula Studio.

Installation link:
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/

## 3. CUDA and CUDNN for NVIDIA
If you are using an Nvidia GPU, you need to install CUDA and CUDNN, to accelerate the Deep learning process and training.

Check the versions of Tensorflow_gpu from the below link and install the corresponding CDA and CUDNN:
https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source_windows

CUDA installation link:
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.2.0-download-archive

CUDNN installtion link:
https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive

## 4. Protocol Buffers
These are the formats that the TensorFlow saves the model in. TensorFlow graphs are represented in a format called protocol buffer.

Install Protoc for Protocol Buffers from the below official Github Repo link:
https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases

## 5. Git Bash
This allows us to use Git commands.

Installation link:
https://git-scm.com/downloads

## 5. TensorFlow Object Dtection API
Allows us to build object detection models way faster.

Clone the below github repo:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models
